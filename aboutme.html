      <h2>Innocent Hove</h2>
    <p>My name is Innocent Hove and I'm studying for my bachelor's degree in Applied Technology at Brigham Young 
University - Idaho. My major is web development. Being a math enthusiast, I have an avid desire to become a data 
scientist. I have barely entered the programming world, and all I can tell is that the field is exciting and 
promising.</p>
    <p>I'm a husband, married for seven years now, and a father of two boys, Jordan (five)and Jared (two). 
I currently work as the Operations Supervisor at Cropserve (Pvt) Ltd, an agrochemicals retail company. I take care of
all the imports from aroung the globe. I'm also involved in the research and devopment of new products on the
market. It is a challenging job, but it lets me use my skills and I learn new skills along the path. In my spare time 
I take my family on walks exploring nature and we also plant vegetable gardens.</p>
    <p>I'm taking the path in techonology as an addition to my skills and training as a biologist. I previously earned
a bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences from the University of Zimbabwe. Learning these new skills will sharpen my
career hence the reason for taking this course.</p>
    <p>I have a strong testimony of our Lord Jesus Christ and the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. I have been a member
of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for 15 years. I love the words of the late prophet David O. MacKay,
"No other success can compensate for failure in your home." All I do is to help my family be happier.</p>
