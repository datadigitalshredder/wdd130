        <h2 class="home-headline-1">The beginnings</h2>
        <p class="home-paragraph-1">If I look back to when I started, school does not seem like it my area. “It is not my thing”, I would often tell myself. I wanted to do well, but merely wanting did not incite any confidence in my learning. I barely made it in my studies and the first years on were very pessimistic. It all changed when I met a good friend who changed my attitude towards learning. That was just the needed motivation to finish my primary education on a positive note.

        <h2 class="home-headline-2">Soldering on</h2>
        <p class="home-paragraph-2">After succeeding in primary school, I went on to continue my education in the capital Harare. It was a new environment that required me to adapt. Evidently, the process of adapting had its negative consequences and for two years, I was not doing as well as I had done before. I guess because I wanted to do well in school, I found myself gradually improving. When I completed junior high school, I had average grades but had failed two of the critical subjects, mathematics and English. What next was a turning point in my life because despite this failure, I decided not to give up.

          <h2 class="home-headline-3">Learning how I learn </h2>
        <p>With a determined resolution to earn a decent education, I retook the classes I had failed which falling behind my classmates. That setback was a much-needed detour for I learned how to learn. That became a tool for success in my education, and even though I faced some grueling hardships such as the unavailability of tutors. But that would not stop and for the most part of high school we did not have tutors. I had to tutor myself and with the courage and confidence I had gathered in myself, I succeeded. I went on to succeed as full-time missionary for the Church and in undergraduate school.
