        <h2 class="home-headline-1">The power of grit</h2>
        <p class="home-paragraph-1">Considering my indigent circumstances, grit may be the best description on my educational path. For without 
          it, I could have easily given up and settled for mediocre. However, having a determination for a better quality of life, I have 
          navigated some of the most oppressing circumstances. I had to accrue loans just to earn a basic education. I have scored good grades 
          even without having the essential computer or internet requirements. Truly, my story is one of grit, sacrifice, and patience.

        <h2 class="home-headline-2">Diligence and sacrifice</h2>
        <p class="home-paragraph-2">My story began when I had to make the choice to finish high school. Things were not promising for me in 
          terms of my educational pursuits. I resolved back then to not give up and that meant being patient and required a great deal of s
          acrifice. Studying late at nights was just one of the sacrifices.

          <h2>It all pays off</h2>
        <p>Sacrificing pays of in time and that requires patience. I have gained enough confidence to pursue an 
          education and I believe I can make changes in my own life.
