        <h2 class="home-headline-1">The power of grit</h2>
        <p class="home-paragraph-1">Considering my indigent circumstances, grit may be the best description on my educational path. For without 
          it, I could have easily given up and settled for mediocre. However, having a determination for a better quality of life, I have 
          navigated some of the most oppressing circumstances. I had to accrue loans just to earn a basic education. I have scored good grades 
          even without having the essential computer or internet requirements. Truly, my story is one of grit, sacrifice, and patience.
